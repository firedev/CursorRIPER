# CursorRIPER - Enhanced Execute Mode
# Version 1.0.1

## COMMAND DESCRIPTION
This command activates the EXECUTE mode with enhanced Cursor-specific features and automatic memory hooks.

## COMMAND STRUCTURE
```
/execute [optional_checkpoint_name]
```

## COMMAND BEHAVIOR
1. Switches to EXECUTE mode
2. Updates project state to reflect current mode
3. Creates a checkpoint in progress.mdc using the optional name if provided
4. Enables all Cursor-specific execute tools and memory hooks
5. Begins implementation of the approved plan

## MEMORY HOOK IMPLEMENTATION

### Pre-Execution Hooks
- Create checkpoint in progress.mdc
- Update focus in activeContext.mdc
- Record execution start in activeContext.mdc changes section

### During-Execution Hooks
- Track implementation progress automatically
- Update activeContext.mdc with currently executing step
- Monitor for file changes and update memory accordingly

### Post-Step Hooks
- Mark step as complete in progress.mdc
- Update completion percentage
- Log any challenges encountered
- Prepare for next step

## EDITOR CONTEXT INTEGRATION

### File Tracking
- All modified files are automatically recorded
- Changes are summarized in both activeContext.mdc and progress.mdc
- File relationships are mapped for dependency tracking

### Implementation Verification
- Each step is validated immediately after completion
- Any issues are flagged and recorded
- Verification status is reported in progress.mdc

## CURSOR-SPECIFIC FEATURES

### Implementation Efficiency
- Batches similar file operations
- Provides intelligent autocomplete during implementation
- Suggests optimizations while maintaining plan fidelity

### Visual Progress Tracking
- Real-time progress indicator
- Step completion visualization
- Time tracking for implementation phases

## USAGE EXAMPLES

### Basic Execute Mode Activation
```
/execute
```

### Execute With Named Checkpoint
```
/execute authentication-implementation
```

### Execute With Step Focus
```
/execute step:3
```

## RELATED COMMANDS
- `/checkpoint [name]` - Create a save point during execution
- `/progress` - Update implementation progress
- `/diff [file]` - Show changes made to file
- `/revert [file]` - Revert changes to a file
- `/step:complete` - Mark current step as complete

## ERROR HANDLING

If implementation encounters issues that prevent following the plan exactly:
1. The issue is automatically documented in activeContext.mdc
2. The execution is paused with explicit warning
3. Recommendation to return to PLAN mode is provided
4. Automatic rollback option is offered if needed
